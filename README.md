# Parking-Lot-Low-Level-Design
The aim is to design a parking lot system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SOLID principles in C++. 
It defines classes for different types of vehicles, such as cars and bikes, and classes for different types of payment structures, such as hourly and handicapped rates.

The system is designed to be scalable, efficient, secure, reliable, and user-friendly. Additionally, it has been created keeping in mind maintainability, reusability, and testability
Functional Requirements for Parking Lot
The following is a list of functional requirements for a parking lot system:

The parking lot system should be able to park cars, bikes, and handicapped vehicles.
 
The system should be able to calculate the cost of parking for each type of vehicle.
